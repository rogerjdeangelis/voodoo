    1. Dataset level summary -- ie number of obs, variable types, static data                                                                 
    2. Cardinality page (primary keys, codes/decodes number of unique values for every variable - EG fails here)                              
    3. Complete frequency for all variables numeric and character with less than 200 levels                                                   
    4. For variables with over 200 levels top 100 most frequent and bottom 100 least frequent Least frequent are the more interesting cases.  
    5. Proc means on all numeric variables                                                                                                    
    6. Proc univariate on all numeric variables

    8. Histograms on all variables with less than 200 levels                                                                                  
    9. Proc contents                                                                                                                          
    10. Frequency of all numeric variables Missing, negative, zero and positive                                                               
    11. Duplicates on single or compound key. Output printed vertically for easy comparison                                                   
    12. Cross tabs of every variable with every other variable top 16 levels (if selectd)                                                     
    13. You can also select one variable to cross tab with all other variables max top 16 levels                                              
    14. Maximum and minimum lengths to hold all numeric and character variables exactly (optimize)                                            
    15. Correlation of all pairs of numeric variables sorted by largest correlation to lowest.                                                
    16. Nice display of max and mins for numeric and character in one table                                                                   
    17. List of identical columns ie date and date1 have equal values on all observations                                                     
    18. One to Many, Many to One, One to Many and Many to Many                                                                                
    19. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Statistics (Cramer relationship amoung catagorical variables)                                                 
    20. Finds missing patterns
