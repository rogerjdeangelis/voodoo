# voodoo

Validation and Verification of Database Tables. Profile any SAS dataset. Cardinality, outliers, top n frequencies, bottom n frequencies, one to many, many to many, associations between numerical and character variables and duplicates on key

What this macro does

see the tail of this program for same usage
You should be able to run this as is.

The macro invocation is at the end of this file

1.   Dataset level summary -- ie number of obs, variable types, static data
2.   Cardinality page  (primary keys, codes/decodes  number of unique
     values for every variable - EG fails here)
3.   Complete frequency for all variables numeric and character with less
     than 200 levels
4.   For variables with over 200 levels top 100 most frequent and bottom
     100 least frequent
     Least frequent are the more interesting cases.
5.   Proc means on all numeric variables
6.   Proc univariate on all numeric variables
7.   Special datetime  analysis
9.   Histograms on all variables with less than 200 levels
10.  Proc contents
11.  Frequency of all numeric variables Missing, negative, zero and positive
12.  Duplicates on single or compound key. Output printed vertically for
     easy comparison
13.  Cross tabs of every variable with every other variable top 16 levels
     (if selectd)
14.  You can also select one variable to cross tab with all other variables
     max top 16 levels
16.  Maximum and minimum lengths to hold all numeric and character variables
     exactly (optimize)
17.  Correlation of all pairs of numeric variables sorted by largest
    correlation to lowest.
18.  Nice display of max and mins for numeric and character in one table
19.  List of identical columns ie date and date1 have equal values on all
     observations
19   One to Many, Many to One, One to Many and Many to Many
20   Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Statistics (Cramer relationship amoung catagorical variables)
21   Finds missing patterns
22   Printout of first 20, middle 20 and last 20 observations.
23   Missing Pattern amalysis
24   Missing populated in a single table
25   Missing Pattern Analysis
